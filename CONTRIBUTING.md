## Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/wbrak/izar-route).
#### Pull Requests

    - PSR-12 Coding Standard - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install PHP Code Sniffer.

    - Add tests! - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

    - Document any change in behaviour - Make sure the README.md and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

    - Consider our release cycle - We try to follow SemVer v2.0.0. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

    - Create feature branches - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

    - One pull request per feature - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

    - Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

#### Running Tests

`$ vendor/bin/phpunit`

##### Happy coding!
